# Housing Prices in the Northeast US: The Impact of Cities 

Project looking at the affordability of housing in the Northeastern United States.

Summary: Utilizing a open-source file from Kaggle that includes the price of houses through most of the United States of America in the year 2023. The data set aligns with the project aim of determining whether proximity to cities increases the price of housing. 

Data Collection: The original data comes from realtor.com, an aggregate site that tracks housing sales. The original data has information from each of the states, but most of the data focuses on the Northeastern US, so I cleaned the data to better focus on this region. 

Why This Dataset: This dataset gives an excellent view of the current state of the housing market broken down into zip codes, and includes helpful information on the houses such as the number of rooms and the amount of land attached to the house.
